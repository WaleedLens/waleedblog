		Hey there! I'm Waleed Alqouzy, a backend engineer who loves making software run faster and smoother. 
		I graduated from King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in December 2024 with a 
		degree in Computer Science, and I'm still learning something new every day.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now, I'm working as a Backend Engineer at Tamara, focusing on performance optimization 
		and building reliable systems. There's something satisfying about seeing your code make a real 
		difference in how things perform.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before Tamara, I was at Rekaz as a Software Engineer, where I worked through the full development 
		lifecycle—from designing features to deploying them. It taught me a lot about turning ideas into 
		working software.
	</p>

	<p>
		My first industry experience was at Lucidya as an intern in 2023. That's where I learned how 
		backend and frontend teams work together, and why communication matters as much as code.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not coding, I love diving into Java internals and database design. I also built a 
		<a href="https://github.com/WaleedLens/Simple-Object-Storage">simple object storage service</a> 
		as a side project that supports multiple backends—check it out if you're curious!
