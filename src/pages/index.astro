			<h1>👋 Hey, I'm Waleed!</h1>
			<p>
				Thanks for stopping by! I'm a software engineer at Tamara, working on making payments 
				faster and better. Most of my days involve diving deep into Java internals and wrestling 
				with databases to squeeze out every bit of performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				I started this blog to share what I learn along the way—whether it's a cool JVM trick, 
				a database optimization that actually worked, or just lessons from building stuff that 
				people use every day.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading about the oil industry (yeah, I'm from Saudi 
				Arabia, so it's kind of in my blood :D). I'm also that person who documents every trip and 
				journey—there's something special about capturing those moments and stories from the road.
			</p>
			<p>So what's on this blog?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Java internals and JVM stuff that actually matters</li>
				<li>Database tips, tricks, and the occasional "why didn't I think of that sooner" moment</li>
				<li>Real-world lessons from building payment systems</li>
				<li>Travel stories and the occasional photo dump from my adventures</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Feel free to explore my <a href="/blog">posts</a> and don't hesitate to reach out 
				if you want to chat about any of this stuff. Always happy to connect!
